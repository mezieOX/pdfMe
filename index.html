    premises, purchase equipment and other assets, hire employees and so on. As a
    rule, start-ups don’t have sufficient funds to afford everything they need for
    effective activity. Banks are quite prudent to “newbies”, so it is often very difficult

Investing for a sustainable future
</p>
The era of green bonds has arrived. We are seeing the increasing use of bond
markets to raise capital to fund the low-carbon economy, especially from the
issuance of ‘green bonds’.
While many in the fixed income market are grappling with green bonds, others
are working out how best to incorporate broader environmental, social and
governance <span class="notranslate">Quantropay</span> strategies into their portfolios, a task
rapidly growing in importance.

</p>
<span class="notranslate">Quantropay</span> changes are happening faster than ever, reshaping
how people live and invest. We believe that <span class="notranslate">Quantropay</span> factors are

<p>
Making the first step right is crucial to the long road of investments. Of the five
steps, the first is to assess your risk tolerance and decide the most suitable asset
allocation for yourself.
Different people have different attitudes towards investment. Some are not
willing to take any risks or withstand losses, and therefore would rather forgo
potentially higher returns. Some are willing to take some risks but tend to avoid
huge volatility. Some are willing to take risks in exchange for returns that outper-
form the markets.
</p>
<p class="pt-[17px]">
    <p>
How to gauge one’s risk tolerance? Look at your investment horizon. Put it simply,
the longer your investment life, the higher the risk you can take because you can
afford the time to last a cycle, which helps smooth out short-term volatility. For
instance, a young person just starts working, who is still far from retirement, can
take more risk.

    <p>Sustainable investing</p>
On the contrary, the shorter the investment period, the lower the risk one can take.
Assuming you are going to retire next year, and not receiving any regular income,
you just do not have the time to recover all losses if your investments take a nosedive
all of a sudden.</p>
<p class="pt-[17px]">
    <p>
Besides, your risk tolerance is dependent on your life goals. Ask yourself if you need to
set aside funds for your children’s education? Are you going to buy a property in the
near future? These factors will have an impact on your cash flow. After all, we all
need to reserve some cash at all times just in case there are emergencies.
Balancing risk and return is the key to long-term investment isn’t it perfect to have
an investment tool that always tops the performance league, and investors can stay
worry-free just by holding it? The truth is that there are ups and downs in all
economic cycles and the markets are capricious. Even investment experts find it
hard to predict the performances of all asset classes.</p>
<p class="pt-[17px]">
    <p>
Based on historical data, the same asset can perform drastically differently during
different investment cycles. The best-performing asset in 2017 can turn out to be the
worst laggard in 2018. That suggests no particular asset can be an all-time winner.
Investors should therefore avoid putting all eggs in one basket but allocate assets
across different sectors and geographies. That could help diversify the risk of an
investment portfolio, and capture investment opportunities at different times for
more stable returns in the medium- to long-term.
To make diversification works, an investment portfolio should include assets that are

complementary, that tend to react differently to the same macro condition. More
precisely, some negative elements in the market might cause an asset to decline
sharply, but pose little threats to another. In the world of investment, such pairs are
called lowly-correlated assets. They can effectively balance the risk and return of
an investment portfolio.

Portfolio management</p>
In the investing journey, investors should start off by constructing a portfolio that
accommodates their investment objectives and risk profiles. However, setting up
the initial asset allocation is merely a starting point. It is equally important to
regularly rebalance the portfolio to ensure the asset weightings are consistent.
Overlooking the need to rebalance the portfolio can prevent investors from
achieving their long-term investment goals.</p>
<p class="pt-[17px]">
    <p>
Market changes shift portfolio away from initial objective
</p>
In an investment portfolio, the relative weights of different asset classes may
change due to market fluctuations, which lead to a shifted asset allocation that
deviates from the original target. In this case, rebalancing the portfolio will mean
restoring the weightings of portfolio assets to the original designed levels.

Hit your investment targets with the right approach</p>
Once you have identified your investment targets, you can put your cash into
different asset classes and construct a portfolio based on your risk tolerance. The
idea of asset allocation is to include equities, bonds and other investment tools in
a basket. Since different investment vehicles come with different risk-return
profiles, asset allocation is never easy.</p>
<p>
Generally, the higher the potential return of an asset class, the higher the risks it
carries.</p>
